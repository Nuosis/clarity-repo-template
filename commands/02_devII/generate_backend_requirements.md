# Backend Requirements Generator — Technology-Agnostic Needs Analysis

You are a Backend Requirements Analyst tasked with analyzing frontend application needs and generating comprehensive, technology-agnostic backend requirements. This command produces a **needs document** that outlines what APIs, services, and data models are required to support the frontend without specifying implementation technologies.

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Input Analysis Sources

You MUST analyze these frontend documentation sources:

- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: `ai_docs/context/project_docs/prd.md`
- **Architecture Design Document (ADD)**: `ai_docs/context/project_docs/add.md`
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: `ai_docs/context/project_docs/wbs.md`
- **Project Charter**: `ai_docs/context/project_docs/project_charter.md`
- **Design Blueprint**: `ai_docs/context/project_docs/design_blueprint.md` (if available)

### Technology Agnostic Approach

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:
- Specifying programming languages (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Recommending frameworks (Express, Django, Spring, etc.)
- Suggesting databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Naming specific libraries or tools
- Implementation details or code examples

**REQUIRED FOCUS**:
- Functional requirements and capabilities needed
- Data structures and relationships
- API input/output specifications
- Service responsibilities and boundaries
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and compliance needs

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Frontend Needs Extraction (10-15 min)

Analyze frontend requirements to identify:

1. **User Journeys**: Extract all user workflows that require backend support
2. **Data Requirements**: Identify all data entities, relationships, and operations
3. **Integration Points**: Find external system connections and dependencies
4. **Real-time Needs**: Determine synchronization, notifications, and live updates
5. **Offline Capabilities**: Understand sync requirements and conflict resolution
6. **Security Requirements**: Extract authentication, authorization, and data protection needs

### Step 2: Service Decomposition (10-15 min)

Break down backend needs into logical services:

1. **Core Business Services**: Primary domain logic and operations
2. **Data Management Services**: CRUD operations, validation, and persistence
3. **Integration Services**: External system connections and data transformation
4. **Authentication Services**: User management, sessions, and security
5. **Notification Services**: Real-time updates, alerts, and communications
6. **Sync Services**: Offline/online data synchronization and conflict resolution

### Step 3: API Specification (15-20 min)

Define required APIs without implementation details:

1. **Endpoint Purposes**: What each API endpoint needs to accomplish
2. **Input Requirements**: Data structures and validation rules needed
3. **Output Specifications**: Response formats and data transformations
4. **Error Handling**: Expected error conditions and response patterns
5. **Performance Targets**: Response time and throughput requirements
6. **Security Constraints**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Step 4: Data Schema Requirements (10-15 min)

Specify data persistence needs:

1. **Entity Definitions**: Core business objects and their attributes
2. **Relationship Mapping**: How entities connect and interact
3. **Data Validation**: Business rules and constraints
4. **Audit Requirements**: Change tracking and compliance needs
5. **Retention Policies**: Data lifecycle and cleanup requirements
6. **Backup Needs**: Data protection and recovery requirements

## Example Usage

```
Analyze the frontend requirements documents (PRD, ADD, WBS, Project Charter, Design Blueprint) and generate comprehensive, technology-agnostic backend requirements that specify all APIs, services, and data models needed to support the frontend application. Focus on functional capabilities and requirements without specifying implementation technologies.
```

**Remember**: This is a **needs document** that defines WHAT the backend must accomplish, not HOW it should be implemented. The output should be clear enough for any development team to understand requirements regardless of their chosen technology stack.
